# Warframe Prime Junk Manager

A tiny app for the free to play game [Warframe](https://www.warframe.com/) to help keep track of your prime inventory and assist in ducat/plat farm.



![Equipment Screen](docs/equipment.png?raw=true)



**Owned** toggle is to filter the items to just the ones you own.

**Vaulted** toggle is for showing vaulted equipment

[**Ducanator**](https://warframe.market/tools/ducats) toggle is for filtering out items that have a high ducat/plat ratio. This is to help you filter out the stuff you might want to sell on [Warframe Market](https://warframe.market/) instead of converting to ducats.

The top right text box is to search specific items.



Every prime set has a progress bar in behind its name that shows how close you are to completing the next set.

At the bottom is a summary of the total plat and ducat value of all the items that are currently being shown in the list.



### Todo:

- Logging
- Relic View
- Relic Planner (suggest which relics to open for maximum plat gain)
- Scrape inventory using image recognition (or other alternatives)
- Embed dependencies into a single binary



### Credits:

- [WFInfo](https://github.com/WFCD/WFinfo) for their live market prices google sheet and updated inventory info.
